# Companies
This is the place where your participants start their journey, they all should flock into their company of choosing. The best group size is about 3 to 5 people.

The companies are:
* [eXtragon Inc.](./xgon.md)
* [IT-Services Ltd](./its.md)
* [More Shipping and Freight LTD](./msf.md)
* [NRG Supplier](./nrg.md)
* [WDC](./wdc.md)

The companies should be chosen, by the participants from their company brief and their short description, like in the real world. 

The rest of the information is only to be presented after the companies are chosen, and players are settling in before disaster strikes.
