# Fire at the office

At 3 a.m. on a week day you are woken by a call on your company cell phone. 

"Hey, am I speaking with lease owner of the [company name],[office address]? This is Seargant Wilfried, I am with the metropolitan fire department. My sorry duty is to inform you, that your office building is on fire."

Luckily no one was hurt. 

How do you proceed?

--- 
* How much of your company/employee hardware was at the office? 1WD10*10% => 25%
* Paper Records have been destroyed, if not otherwise stated.
* What critical systems have been destroyed.
