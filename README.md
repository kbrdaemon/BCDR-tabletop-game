# Introduction

This is a tabletop role playing game to teach the players about Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery. 

The aim of it is, to show how hard it can be to make decisions in stressful situations and resolve issues in a timely manner.

The average game duration should be about one hour, depending on the length of the course. Afterwards the teams should present their outcome to the other participants in a informal spoken summary.


## Materials needed
The optimal requirements are:
* 1-2 20-sided dice
* 1 6-sided dice
* 1 10-sided dice

Alternatively you can use e.g.: a Python interpreter
```python
import secrets
secrets.randbelow(20)+1 # +1 because randbelow returns [0,n)
```

## Roles

### Players

The players form into groups of 3-5 people and select a company from their description and briefs. They than draw from a selection of roles, who they will have access to during the disaster event. The roles differ between companies according to their maturity level.

The players have to navigate the disaster during the course of the game without destroying the company or losing all of their customers. They decide on their actions in accordance with any documentation they have at hand during the disaster. Theses decisions are then presented to the game master, who will give out information or more events based on the decisions the players make.

### The Game master

The GM, or Master of Disaster in this case, prepares the company briefs, and chooses scenarios for each company selected by the players. How he or she does that is up to his or her discretion. 

To make the game fun and complex, the material lined out here is more of a rough outline for each company and scenario. Game masters should keep in mind, to they have full control over their game the goal for it is to be educational and not a sadistic one-sided massacre of the players in the inevitable end of their chosen corporate hellscape.
